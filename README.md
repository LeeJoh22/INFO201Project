In the last century the United States has begun to develop a notorious reputation due to its citizens' poor lifestyle choices that result in high levels of health related deaths like cancer, obesity, diabetes, and more. Chronic diseases and health conditions impact the overall health of the population, and our first dataset explores the leading causes of death over a span of nearly 20 years across each of the 50 states. Out of 10 leading causes of death, 9 of them were healthcare related. The high suicide levels across the nation reflect the high stress levels people feel and the lack of mental help resources that influence these rates. While lifestyle choices do not solely account for kidney disease, heart disease, diabetes, or respiratory disease, which rank among the leading causes, they can significantly contribute to or exacerbate these conditions. Along with the poor lifestyle choices, the lack of a national healthcare system in the U.S. limits the availability of affordable access to healthcare services and treatments. Medical care in America is one of the most expensive healthcare systems, yet ranks last compared to other industrialized countries. Health insurance aims to protect people from those high costs and provide screenings as preventative care, but insurance plans are expensive, often provide inadequate benefits, have high deductibles, and have gaps in coverage. This combination of poor population health and unreasonably priced and unaccessible healthcare leads to high rates of health related deaths. By comparing the leading causes of death in each state to the types of healthcare insurance coverage that is used in each state, we hope to better understand the relationship between healthcare coverage and health related deaths. 

This topic is interesting because healthcare and death are factors of life that everyone must deal with. As the cost of living and healthcare only seem to be increasing, it is becoming increasingly important to lead more health conscious lives and be aware of which insurances provide the best and most affordable access to live life to the fullest. We are curious to see if there is a connection between how states are insured and how high the health related deaths are. The comparison of these two datasets will hopefully allow us to answer the following questions:

How does the average uninsured percentage by regions in the US affect the average number of deaths per 100,000 between 2008 and 2017? Does higher uninsured percentage lead to higher number of deaths on average?

Do regions/states with higher percentages of “low income insurance/no insurance” have higher rates of deaths by diseases that could be medically treated/prevented like heart disease and diabetes? Are there relationships between certain health insurance types and deaths that are commonly associated with the population that holds said insurance type? 

Does a specific region of the US have higher average deaths per 100,000 in categories like heart disease, stroke, and cancer which could be medically linked to each other? Do we see trends in other causes of death in specific regions of the US?

The results of comparing these sets can potentially be of interest to a very wide range of people. This includes young people who want to know which insurance type could help them stay healthy, people concerned with health trends, or even insurance groups who want to use data to incentivise customers that their insurance is the best. The potential relationship between these datasets can also be of interest to policy makers who are arguing for or against changes to the current healthcare system.
