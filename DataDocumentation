```  The research questions we are focused on are trying to discover relationships between types of insurance coverage and general health of different regions of the United States in addition to healthiest and unhealthiest regions. The first dataset we chose was a dataset that contains data from 1999-2017 on the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States. The general population of this dataset was the entire United States and population per state which was one reason why we chose it. Another reason why we selected this dataset was because it was extremely detailed in its breakdown of where the numbers were coming from and had organized, easy to understand data. Since the dataset had a breakdown of deaths for each cause by state, total deaths from all 10 causes by state, and total deaths for the entire United States, it would allow us a lot of flexibility in the questions we wanted to research and how we joined datasets. The variables of the dataset were also informative because it gave us total values in addition to deaths per 100,000 so analysis we performed would be relative to the size of states and not be skewed by state size. This first dataset originated from Data.gov and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention websites. The data was collected by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Health and Human Services. The number of deaths for each cause was derived from information from all resident death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia using demographic and medical characteristics. Mortality rate per 100,000 post 2010 was derived based on the 2000 US standard population and updated intercensal population. For 2010 and onward, it was derived using the census. Since the data originated from a trustworthy source, we knew the numbers would provide accurate answers to questions we were trying to answer. It is also public and can be used freely - mainly for research and educational purposes. This dataset was very complete with essentially no missing data as it came from a government source which means that future data cleaning would be very easy.```

  The second dataset we chose contained data on insurance coverage by state from 2008-2017. It provided a detailed breakdown of the percent of people on different types of insurance in each state over the years and for the United States population as a whole. With the population being measured by the data being the same, we would be able to analyze our research questions effectively. The types of insurance fell in the following categories: Employer, Non-Group, Medicaid, Medicare, Military, and Uninsured. This dataset was also very complete meaning that when joining there wouldn’t need to be a lot of data cleaning. Another significant reason for why we chose this dataset was because it made data merging very easy. This dataset had a years column and states column which are also present in the first dataset we chose. Both datasets also provided data over a decade or more meaning we could research trends in the data to find more in depth and concrete answers to our research questions. The data is collected by the Kaiser Family Foundation(KFF) which is a source for health policy research, polling, and news. The data is based on the 2008-2022 American Community Survey and excluded the 1-year estimates for 2020 due to significant disruptions to the data collection because of the coronavirus pandemic. It is also a public dataset on the organization’s website and is free to use. ```
  
	The final datasets that we used in our analysis are a combination of the two datasets with key variables being derived from the information in the datasets we selected. The main dataset that is derived from joining the two that we found contains data of total deaths from all 10 causes, deaths in total, deaths per 100,000 relative to population size, region of the United States a state is in, and a breakdown of different insurance coverage percentages by population from 2008-2017 for all 50 states and the United States as a whole. It was joined based on years and states that both datasets had in common. Each row in the dataset represents the number of deaths and insurance coverage distribution percentages for a specific cause of death in a specific year for a state or US as a whole between 2008-2017. In total, there are 5720 observations with no missing data. The following clarifies the meaning and derivation of variables that were used in our analysis from the main joined dataset:```

- Year - provided by dataset, year the data is from
- Cause Name - provided by dataset, specific cause of death
- State - provided by dataset, state the data represents
- Deaths - provided by dataset, total number of deaths for a state or the United States as a whole
- Age-adjusted Death Rate - provided by dataset, number of deaths per 100,000 relative to state or country population
- Employer - provided by dataset, percentage of population on employer provided insurance
- Non-Group - provided by dataset, percentage of population on individually bought/not employer provided insurance
- Medicaid - provided by dataset, percentage of population on government assisted insurance (low income)
- Medicare - provided by dataset, percentage of population on federal health insurance program (elderly and disabled)
- Military - provided by dataset, percentage of population on military insurance
- Uninsured - provided by dataset, percentage of population with no insurance
- Region - derived using state name which was passed into a function that returned region based on the state name and mutated the joined datasets, region of the United States a state is in (for United States, it is just US)
- Low_income_insurance - derived using sum of Medicaid and Uninsured percentages in each observation and mutated the joined dataset, percentage of population classified as having low income

	The second dataset that was used in our analysis was a summarization data frame consisting of variables inherited or derived from the datasets we had selected and aggregations of data points. It consists of yearly data from 2008-2017 of regional average deaths per 100,000 for all causes of death and average uninsured percentage. Each row in the data frame describes the average deaths per 100,000 and average uninsured percentage of a given region in a given year. In total there are 60 rows and there were no missing data points. The new variables that were calculated for this data frame include avg_age_adjusted_death_rate and avg_uninsured_rate. Average_age_adjusted_death_rate was derived by filtering the joined data for deaths classified as “all causes” first then grouping by year and region and finally finding the mean of “Age-adjusted Death Rate”, ignoring null values. Average_uninsured_rate underwent the same filtering and grouping except it used the mean of “Uninsured”, ignoring null values. The following clarifies the meaning and derivation of variables that were used in our analysis from the summarization dataset:

- Year - provided by joined dataset, year data is associated with
- Region - calculated earlier and inherited from joined dataset, region of the United States a state is associated with
- Avg_age_adjusted_death_rate - derived from joined dataset using procedure described above, average number of deaths per 100,000 for a given region for all causes of death
- Avg_uninsured_rate - derived from joined dataset using procedure described above, average percentage of individuals in a given region who are uninsured
